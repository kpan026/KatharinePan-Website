        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Katharine Pan, and my pronouns are she/her. I currently study biology as a first-year here at the University of California, Riverside. I plan to go on to veterinary school after achieving my Bachelor's degree in pursuit of my dream of becoming a veterinarian.<br><br>

        I attended high school at Ayala High School in Chino Hills, CA. Here, I took a total of 10 AP tests, with an average score of 3.6. This earned me the AP Scholar with Distinction Award from Collegeboard. In preparation for college, I took the SAT, with my highest score being 1470. During my time in high school I enjoyed a variety of extracurricular activities. The most notable of these is marching band, which I participated in all four years. We competed at the national competition in Indianapolis, IN, in my junior year, earning 12th place. During my senior year I volunteered to help out as a field manager, preparing the field before practice and helping out underclassmen. I'll always remember and be thankful for my time in marching band as it taught me a wide variety of skills, such as those of time management and collaboration.  I also took part in various clubs, inluding Asian Club and DIY Club, joining their officer boards during my upperclassman years. Finally, I participated in various volunteering efforts. Throughout my four years, I was a member of Gateway Leadership Academy, an organization aimed at teaching students leadership skills while helping us earn volunteer hours. In my senior year, I joined this group's media team, taking photos of our events and posting them on Instagram. This experience helped me practice a variety of skills, including organizational and social, as well as taught me several helpful social media tips. I began going to my local pet shelter, Priceless Pets, in sophomore year of high school. Here, my friends and I completed various tasks every other week, including walking dogs and cleaning kennels. This experience provided invaluable hands-on experience that I will utilize during my time in the veterinary field.<br><br>

        In terms of real-life and in-person work experience, I have gathered enough since high school to have obtained a wide array of knowledge that help me decide how to approach any problems I face currently. My first job was as a food and beverage cashier at my local Big League Dreams, a baseball and softball tournament center for children's teams. This position taught me to move swiftly in a fast-paced environment and speak patiently with less understanding customers. My second job was as a front desk attendant at QD Learning, a speech and debate club and tutoring center. Here I learned various managerial skills, including using Excel and Canva, as well as learning and conveying a selection of classes to prospective customers. I value both of these job experiences as they provided a variety of skills and viewpoints about the customer service sector. I utilize what I've learned from them in my current job as a cashier at the Market at Glen Mor under UCR Dining. I'm sure I will continue to learn from experience here at UCR and apply the skills in my future endeavors.
